# My Piano

piano.py, when run, opens a window that simulates a two-octave piano.

## Installation

Packages needed to run piano.py: tkinter/Tkinter, simpleaudio, time and \_thread.

In Python 2, it is called Tkinter, while in Python 3, it is called tkinter. I found the
version control code here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17843596/difference-between-tkinter-and-tkinter

All of the notes that are used I found from https://www.freesound.org/people/jobro/packs/2489/?page=1#sound

All of the images that you see I created myself in http://www.picmonkey.com
